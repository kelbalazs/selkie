    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
    Selkie Chocolates is a family-run business, nestled at the gates of the Scottish Highlands.

Fuelled by our lifelong passion (obsession?) for quality chocolate, the creation, design, recipe development (and testing... mmm...) brings us an indescribable joy that we must share with the world.

What started in the kitchen of our first flat has grown into a comfortable, high-quality small-batch chocolate factory, always welcoming us with the sweet aroma of the food of the gods.

Our mission is to share our love for ethical chocolate, crafted from exceptional ingredients and a generous sprinkle of love, so everyone can experience those special moments of bliss with every bite. We use biodegradable and recyclable packaging, so whatever is left after you've enjoyed your chocolate (the wrapper) will leave behind only a contented smile on your face, while everything else naturally decomposes.

We invite you to savour these legendary flavours and embark on an otherworldly chocolate experience with the Selkie Chocolate Bars.
